    "For our regression problem, budget outperforms runtime in predicting box office because it has much higher R^2 values and lower MSE values. It can be concluded that budget has some positive relationship with box office and is able to predict it to a certain extent. On the other hand, runtime has no clear relationship with box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "After tuning the hyperparameters, the best degree for single variate polynomial regression is 1, which indicates that the data suits a linear relationship more than a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "The best model for predicting box office for using budget is decision tree regressor while the best model for runtime is KNN regressor."

    "For clustering, we find that both approaches gave similar results. The top words of successful clusters indicate that they contain a franchise, and tend to have the element of actions or crime as a common theme in the clusters. Movie makers could consider incorporating these elements into their movies."
